## What is DKMap about?
DKMap helps you make sense of multimodal embeddings — especially those from vision-language models — by showing how well text and images align. Traditional methods like t-SNE often fail to accurately reflect alignment metrics due to projection distortion and over-averaging. DKMap solves this with a dynamic kernel approach that makes the visualizations both more accurate and more interactive. You can zoom in, explore local details, and use it in your browser or Jupyter notebook.

## Highlights
✨ Scalable to <strong>billions</strong> of <strong>multimodal embedding</strong> point

✨ Enables <strong>multi-resolution</strong> exploration via kernel
refinement

✨ Dynamically adjusts the granularity of the contour map for more flexible exploration.

✨ Support multi-platform development -- <strong>computational notebooks</strong> (e.g., Colab, Jupyter, VS Code) and <strong>Web-based system</strong>
